#+TITLE: Data Analysis Instructions

* Combining Runs

1. Load CombinerFrame (found on the Desktop)
2. Click "Add"
3. Go to the directory "C:\userfiles\EXP011".  This is most likely the
   parent directory of the default folder that pops up.
4. Open the directory for one of the runs which you wish to combine.
5. Open the "runinfo" file in that directory.
6. Repeat steaps 2 through 5 for each run which you wish to combine.
7. Click "Open"
8. In the bottom frame, there will be a list of current configurations
   used in the different runs.  Click on all the ones which apply.
   (For the transmission measurements, these will just be all zeros,
   as we're not doing any sort of flipping measurement).
9. Click "Save"
10. Choose a directory and name the file.

* Viewing Data

All of the data analysis is setup to run through PelVis.  It can be
found on the desktop.  A run can be loaded by choosing File->Open and
openening the corresponding neutron_event file.  PelVis will
automaitcally load the corresponding montir file.

Regions are chosen on the detector image by making a left click in the
upper left hand corner of the region and a right click in the lower
right hand.  Alternately, regions can be entered by defining the
maximum and minimum X and Y in the panel on the right of the window.

To subtract the background, chose a region away from the main beam,
then choose Noise->"Region of Disinterest" from the menu.  If you need
to undo the background subtraction, you'll need to load the file over again.

To plot the spectrum, choose a region and pick File->Spectrum from the
menu.  A dialog will pop-up.  Click View to view a graph of the
spectrum and save to export the spectrum to a text file.
* Reduction

Using the combiner can be time consuming if you have a large amount of
data, so I wrote the reduction script for handling longer runs

To run the reduction, type

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    c:\Python27\python.exe reduction.py *start* *stop*
#+END_QUOTE

into the command prompt while in the PELVis directory.  *start* should
be the run number of the start of the run and *stop* should be the
number of the firth run _NOT_ in this dataset.

The --help option provides more information about the options for Reduction.

** Flipping Runs

For a simple flipping run, you'll need to use the following parameters:

| parameter | values                                      | meaning                                                                                                                        |
| --flip    | flipper,guides,sample,phase,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 | This is the power supply being used as the flipper.  For most runs, this should just be flipper                                |
| -e        |                                             | This flag tells reduction to export the combined data into a file.  For flipping runs, it's simpler to just leave the flag in. | 

The exported data will be saved as two files (up and down) in the directory of the last run.

As an example:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
c:/Python27/python.exe reduction.py --flip flipper 697 754 -e
#+END_QUOTE
  
Will save two files in the directory for run 753 containing the two different states of the flipper supply.

** Current Scans

For more complicated scans over a current, you'll also need the following.

| parameter | values                                      | meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --flip    | flipper,guides,sample,phase,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 | This is the power supply being used as the flipper.  For most runs, this should just be flipper                                                                                                                                     |
| -e        |                                             | This flag tells reduction to export the combined data into a file.  For flipping runs, it's simpler to just leave the flag in.                                                                                                      |
| --sortby  | flipper,guides,sample,phase,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 | This is the current value that is scanned.  The exported runs will be grouped by their value in this current, to the nearest 0.1A                                                                                                   |
| --start   | *number*                                    | The lowest value in the current scan                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --stop    | *number*                                    | The highest value in the current scan                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --stop    | *number*                                    | The step size of the current scan                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --plot    | fr,echo                                     | This is an optional flag for producing a quick plot frmo the reduction.  Using fr will produce a plot of integrated flipping ratio versus current while echo will produce a colormap of polarization versus current and wavelength. | 

As an example  :

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
c:/Python27/python.exe reduction.py --flip flipper 703 755 --start -4 --stop 3 --step 1 --plot fr --sortby 8
#+END_QUOTE

would plot the integrated flipping ratio versus the current in power supply 8 for runs 703 through 754 and with currents of [-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]
